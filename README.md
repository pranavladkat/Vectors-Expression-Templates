# Vectors-Expression-Templates

Vector class using Expression Templates. The Template Metaprogramming in C++ allows us to use templates to represent expressions. It also allows us to perform lazy evaluations of the expressions which reduces allocation of temporary variables in calculations, hence increasing the performance of the code. Here's a small example which I wrote to represent a vector of type double. The code uses Curiously Recurring Template Pattern.
